&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"WTF is a 'Super Robot Quest'? Where am I?!!"<br />
<br />
Don't worry thats what this .txt file is for!<br /><br />

Super Robot Quest is a platformer game made by SK3LL!X. It's part 2D, part 3D, and completely fun!
It uses Three.js, Box2dWeb, and jQuery. It's an HTML5 game so most browsers will run in without
any trouble whatsoever. Feel free to dig through the files and fork it to your hearts content. Just
make sure I get credited like I'm crediting wwwtyro right now! His game Astray helped me figure out
how to pull this damn game off, so go check out his shit with these links
